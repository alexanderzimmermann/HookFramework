Installation

.. See the :ref:`requirements appendix <requirements>` for a detailed list of requirements for Hook Framework.

Download `Hook Framework's Git repository`_ using a `Git`_ client. Hook Framework is open source software,
and the Git repository used for its development is publicly available on `GitHub`_. Consider using Git to get
Hook Framework if you want to contribute back to the framework, or need to upgrade your framework version more
often than releases occur.

Once you have a copy of Hook Framework available, the hook framework needs some configuration in
order to access all the informations needed for the :ref:`listener <svn.listener.introduction>`.
