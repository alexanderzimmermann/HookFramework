Overview
********

Hook Framework 2 is an open source framework for helping php developers build subversion hooks
using *PHP* 5.3+.

.. note::

    *HF2* is not backward compatible with *HF1*, because of the new features in PHP 5.3+ implemented by
    the framework, and due to major rewrites of many components.

We use `PHPUnit`_ to test the code s a Continuous Integration service.

See :doc:`listener <svn.listener.introduction>`
