Introduction
============

The directory ``repositories`` is the base directory where the version control system *repository*
folders are stored. It is possible to mix the VCS directories within the ``repositories``.

.. _core.repositories.introduction.repositoryname:

Convention of repository name
-----------------------------

The repository folder name should be like that, what you used when you :ref:`installed <introduction.installation>` the hooks.

For subversion the name should also correspond to that, what was created on the subversion server.

If you, for example, checkout your working copy with http://svn.example.com/ExampleSvn then your
folder is just ``ExampleSvn``.
